My take on the Unity 3d's simple roll a ball game

### Game Basics

- Click on New Game to start playing
- Use arrow keys to move the ball around
- Collect pick up sprites to score points
- Reach the goal with a minimum score of 50 to win the game
 
### Scoring
- Cubes - Low value pickups; Worth 1 point each; easy to collect; spread throught the arena
- Capsules - High value pickups; Worth 2 point each; harder to collect; spread across but must be careful while collecting
- Spheres - Special pickups; Worth 5 points each; available only at specific locations
